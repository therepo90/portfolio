                    I started developing at the age of ~10 around 2000. It was a Microsoft Word webpage for my Diablo clan. After week of doing it and being so
                    proud of my first creation(marquees, pink and purple colors all over the place) my friends told me it's a crap and they would do much
                better in 10 minutes with a notepad. <br /><br />I dropped webdev for a while and around 2001 I've moved to creating client-side modifications for
                Counter-Strike game(custom graphics, commands, sounds, maps). It was pretty hilarious as I recall but a lot of fun surely... <br /> <br />
                    At the age of 13 I met a friend named Lukas at school and he told me he created Calculator! I was incredibly impressed
                    and wanted to created my own. So he showed me Visual Basic macros in Microsoft Office and during one lesson we've created
                    simple calculator app(of course with pink buttons and icky background). I was astonished. When I went home I wanted to do it myself to mess around
                    with it and add additional functionalities (square root ftw!).
                <br />So i ran microsoft office and opened macros and ... I forgot what are the commands
                    and didn't know what should I type to make it work. It was 2003 and ... there was no ISP in my home and no documentation whatsoever. So... I used landline phone
                    and called him and asked him to tell me the exact commands and lines to type. It was hilarious but after 20 minutes of typing I had my calculator working.
                <br />
                    I was super happy and wanted to create even more.
